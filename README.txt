HOW THE PROGRAM WORKS
Assuming the word to guess is "apple" and the user has 5 turns.

1. the game picks a random 5-letter word from your word bank (e.g apple).
2. the player has 5 turns to guess the word.
3. for each guess:

- the correct letter in the correct posistion are shown.
- correct letters in the wrong position are tracked as "misplaced"
- incorrect letters are tracked as "incorrect".
- the game displays the current state after each guess.

4. if the player guesses the word, they win. if not the game ends after 5 turns and reveals the word.
